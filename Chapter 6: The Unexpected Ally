CHAPTER 6: THE UNEXPECTED ALLY

Evelyn’s return to her own time brought a sense of relief, but also a new set of challenges. She knew that Dr. Blackwood’s influence had left lasting effects on the timeline. Determined to uncover any remaining disruptions, she continued her research with renewed vigor. The familiar hum of her lab’s equipment and the soft glow of her computer screen became her constant companions.
One day, while sifting through historical records, Evelyn stumbled upon a series of anomalies that piqued her interest. These anomalies pointed to a young historian named Alex, who had been researching similar patterns. Intrigued, Evelyn reached out to Alex, hoping to find a kindred spirit in her quest to protect the timeline.
Alex was a brilliant and passionate historian, driven by a deep curiosity about the past. When Evelyn explained her situation, Alex was both astonished and excited. The idea of time travel and its implications fascinated them, and they eagerly agreed to join Evelyn in her mission. The two quickly bonded over their shared dedication to preserving history.
Together, Evelyn and Alex formed a formidable team. Alex’s expertise in history complemented Evelyn’s scientific knowledge, and they began to uncover more about Dr. Blackwood’s plans. Late nights in the lab were filled with animated discussions and the rustling of old documents. They discovered that Dr. Blackwood had left behind a network of loyal followers, each one working to further his agenda.
