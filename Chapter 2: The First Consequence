CHAPTER 2: THE FIRST CONSEQUENCE

Evelyn’s determination to fix the timeline led her to meticulously analyze the changes in her present. She spent hours poring over historical records, scientific journals, and her own research notes. The soft glow of her desk lamp illuminated the pages, casting long shadows across the room. It became clear that her brief presence in the past had set off a chain reaction of events, leading to the rise of the mysterious corporation now funding her lab.
As she delved deeper, Evelyn discovered that the corporation, known as ChronoTech, had been founded by a brilliant but enigmatic scientist named Dr. Marcus Blackwood. His research and inventions had revolutionized various fields, but his methods and motivations remained shrouded in secrecy. The more she learned about him, the more uneasy she felt.
Evelyn’s curiosity about Dr. Blackwood grew, and she decided to investigate further. She accessed ChronoTech’s archives, a vast digital repository filled with classified documents and research papers. The cold, sterile environment of the archive room sent a shiver down her spine. As she sifted through the files, she uncovered a trove of information about Blackwood’s experiments with time travel. It became evident that he had been using time travel to manipulate events for his own gain, creating a future where he held immense power.
Realizing the gravity of the situation, Evelyn knew she had to confront Dr. Blackwood and undo the damage he had caused. Her mind raced with thoughts of the potential consequences if she failed. She prepared herself for another journey through time, determined to set things right. With the neural interface securely strapped to her wrist, she activated the device and braced herself for the journey ahead.
As the familiar sensation of being pulled through a tunnel of light enveloped her, Evelyn’s heart pounded with a mix of fear and resolve. She knew that the path ahead would be fraught with challenges, but she was ready to face them head-on. The future of the timeline depended on her success.
