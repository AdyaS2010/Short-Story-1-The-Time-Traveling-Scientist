Chapter 7: The Hidden Laboratory

Evelyn and Alex’s investigation led them to a hidden laboratory in an abandoned mansion on the outskirts of the city. The mansion, once a grand estate, now stood in eerie silence, its walls covered in ivy and its windows darkened by years of neglect. Inside, they found evidence of Dr. Blackwood’s extensive time-traveling exploits.
The laboratory was a treasure trove of advanced technology and historical artifacts. Each item told a story of manipulation and deceit, revealing the extent of Dr. Blackwood’s influence on the timeline. Evelyn and Alex meticulously documented their findings, determined to understand the full scope of his plans.
As they delved deeper into the lab, they uncovered detailed plans outlining Dr. Blackwood’s next target: a pivotal moment in the history of neuroscience. He intended to prevent a major breakthrough that would have far-reaching implications for the future. Evelyn realized that this breakthrough was the foundation of her own research. If Dr. Blackwood succeeded, it would erase her life’s work and alter the course of scientific progress.
