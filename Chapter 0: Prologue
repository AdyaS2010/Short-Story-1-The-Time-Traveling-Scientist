PROLOGUE

The concept of time had always fascinated Dr. Evelyn Carter. As a child, she would spend hours lost in books about the mysteries of the universe, dreaming of the possibilities that lay beyond the confines of the present. Her insatiable curiosity and relentless pursuit of knowledge led her to the field of neuroscience, where she sought to unlock the secrets of the human brain.
Years of dedication and hard work had culminated in her latest invention: a neural interface designed to enhance cognitive functions. Little did she know that this device would become the key to an extraordinary journey, one that would challenge her understanding of reality and test the limits of her scientific prowess.
In the quiet solitude of her lab, Evelyn often pondered the ethical implications of her work. She was acutely aware of the responsibility that came with scientific discovery. The potential for both progress and peril weighed heavily on her mind. Yet, she remained driven by the belief that her research could change the world for the better.
As she prepared for another late-night experiment, a sense of anticipation filled the air. The hum of machines and the glow of monitors created an atmosphere of both excitement and trepidation. Evelyn took a deep breath, her fingers hovering over the controls of the neural interface.
Unbeknownst to her, this night would mark the beginning of an adventure that would transcend the boundaries of time and space. An accidental discovery would propel her into a world of historical intrigue, unforeseen consequences, and a battle to protect the very fabric of reality.
The journey ahead would be fraught with challenges, but Evelyn was no stranger to adversity. With her intellect, determination, and unwavering sense of purpose, she would navigate the complexities of time travel and confront the forces that sought to reshape history.
As the clock struck midnight, Evelyn activated the neural interface, setting in motion a series of events that would forever alter the course of her life. The path before her was uncertain, but one thing was clear: the future of the timeline rested in her hands
