CHAPTER 1: THE ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY

Dr. Evelyn Carter was a renowned neuroscientist, celebrated for her groundbreaking research on the human brain. Her lab, nestled in the heart of a bustling city, was a sanctuary of innovation and discovery. Late one evening, as the city outside buzzed with life, Evelyn found herself alone in her lab, engrossed in her latest experiment.
The room was dimly lit, with the soft hum of machines providing a comforting background noise. The faint scent of antiseptic lingered in the air, mingling with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Evelyn’s desk was cluttered with notes, diagrams, and prototypes of her latest invention: a neural interface designed to enhance cognitive functions. She had been working tirelessly on this project, driven by the hope that it could revolutionize the field of neuroscience.
As she adjusted the settings on the device, a sudden surge of energy coursed through the lab. The lights flickered, and a blinding flash enveloped the room. Evelyn felt a strange sensation, as if she were being pulled through a tunnel of light. When the light subsided, she found herself in an unfamiliar place.
Disoriented, Evelyn looked around. The lab was gone, replaced by a quaint, cobblestone street lined with old-fashioned buildings. The air was filled with the clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the chatter of people dressed in early 20th-century attire. Panic set in as she realized she had somehow traveled back in time.
Her heart raced as she checked the neural interface, which was still strapped to her wrist. To her astonishment, it seemed to have undergone some modifications. The device now displayed a series of unfamiliar symbols and readings. Evelyn’s scientific curiosity overpowered her fear, and she began to experiment with the interface.
As she explored the past, Evelyn marveled at the simplicity and charm of the early 20th century. She visited libraries, attended lectures, and observed the daily lives of people from a bygone era. The scent of fresh bread from a nearby bakery and the sound of children playing in the streets filled her senses. However, her fascination was tempered by the nagging worry that her presence might have unintended consequences.
After a few days, Evelyn decided it was time to return to her own time. She activated the neural interface, hoping it would reverse the process. Another flash of light enveloped her, and she found herself back in her lab. But something was different.
The lab was no longer the modest, cluttered space she knew. It had been transformed into a state-of-the-art facility, complete with advanced technology and a team of researchers she didn’t recognize. Evelyn’s heart sank as she realized that her brief sojourn in the past had altered the timeline.
Her colleagues greeted her with a mix of confusion and concern. They spoke of a massive corporation that now funded their research, a corporation that Evelyn had never heard of. Her own research had taken a completely new direction, and she struggled to make sense of the changes.
Evelyn knew she had to find a way to fix the timeline. She couldn’t let her accidental discovery wreak havoc on the future. With a heavy heart and a determined mind, she resolved to use her knowledge and the neural interface to navigate the complexities of time travel and restore the world to its rightful course.
